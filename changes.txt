** Features:
- md5sum marks can now be generated in an auxillary file instead of
  the view file. This reduces the clutter in the source files. See
  the -md5sum_in_auxfile command line option
- repetitive marks can be avoided. For instance often got things such as
    (*e: common.mli basic features *)
    (*s: common.mli basic features *)
  as often append chunks together. Instead of the 2 preceding marks, we can
  just generate"
    (*x: common.mli basic features *)  
  This again reduces the clutter in the source files.
  See the -less_marks command line option. See also emacs/fix_noweb.el
  for tricks to put in a special color those marks.
- support for multiple files; Your literate document can now be splitted
  in multiple .nw files and still synced. You can thus sync M original
  files vs N view files. Have to use some tricks to make it work though.
- better file position information when something goes wrong in
  the original document or views.

* 0.2

** Features:
- show contextual diff of changes instead of just the 2 variations. Helpful
  when modify big chunks.
- can now handle multiple languages output, not just ocaml, with the -lang
  command line option
- can reorder chunk in orig without causing synchronisation needs.
- handle what before was stopping the synchronisation of
  "a chunk has been deleted"
- better error message, show chunk name

** Internals: 
- reorganize types 

** Bugfix: 
- agglomerate chunkname in view_of_orig
- dont print space for blank_string line, otherwise make sync will not fixpoint

** Documentations:
- describe limitations
- add stuff on copy-paste and AOP
- improved documentation related to emacs
