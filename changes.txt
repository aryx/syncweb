* 0.8 (Q1 2026) ()

** Features:
- new syncweb -loc action to give statistics about the .nw file such
  as the lines of code (LOC) and lines of explanations (LOE).

** lpizer
- new -suffix option

** internals:
- new -dump_orig action to dump the internal representation of a .nw file

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.8 (Q3 2025) (Dockerfile and GHA CI)

** testinfra
- Dockerfile and docker.yml GHA (GitHub Actions) CI check

* 0.7 (Q2 2025) ()

** indexer
- resume indexer, switch to dune and latest semgrep libs

** lpizer
- resume lpizer, switch to dune and latest semgrep libs

** internals:
- update to latest commons in semgrep 1.109.0

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.6 (Q2 2024) ()

** internals:
- update to latest commons in semgrep 1.70.0

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.5 (Q1 2023) (use dune)

** internals:
- switch to dune

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* 0.4 (Q1 2018) ()

** Features:
- automatic indexing provided by codegraph!
- index for defs and uses of entities, including record fields!
  (better than ctwill of Knuth?)
- mini-indexes a la ctwill of Knuth (see his books such as MMIXware).

** Internals:
- bypass completely noweb. Generate .tex directly
  (I used to have a noweblatexpad script, but it was a hack, and
  for the automatic indexing, easier to bypass noweb which is not
  a big help)

* 0.3 ()

** Features:
- md5sum marks can now be generated in an auxillary file instead of
  the view file. This reduces the clutter in the source files. See
  the -md5sum_in_auxfile command line option
- repetitive marks can be avoided. For instance often got things such as
    (*e: common.mli basic features *)
    (*s: common.mli basic features *)
  as often append chunks together. Instead of the 2 preceding marks, we can
  just generate"
    (*x: common.mli basic features *)  
  This again reduces the clutter in the source files.
  See the -less_marks command line option. See also emacs/fix_noweb.el
  for tricks to put in a special color those marks.
- support for multiple files; Your literate document can now be splitted
  in multiple .nw files and still synced. You can thus sync M original
  files vs N view files. Have to use some tricks to make it work though.
- better file position information when something goes wrong in
  the original document or views.

* 0.2 ()

** Features:
- show contextual diff of changes instead of just the 2 variations. Helpful
  when modify big chunks.
- can now handle multiple languages output, not just ocaml, with the -lang
  command line option
- can reorder chunk in orig without causing synchronisation needs.
- handle what before was stopping the synchronisation of
  "a chunk has been deleted"
- better error message, show chunk name

** Internals: 
- reorganize types 

** Bugfix: 
- agglomerate chunkname in view_of_orig
- dont print space for blank_string line, otherwise make sync will not fixpoint

** Documentations:
- describe limitations
- add stuff on copy-paste and AOP
- improved documentation related to emacs

* 0.1 ()

** first public release

** Features:
- fine grained sync using md5sum

* -----------------------------------------------------------

* Beta ()

** Features:
- sync
- specific to ocaml
- make a few assumptions on format of literate document and its markup.

* Alpha ()
