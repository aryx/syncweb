(* For the moment the multi file support is really a hack. I just 
 * abuse the Tex constructor to remember that a serie of tex_or_chunkdef 
 * belongs to a file. This hack allows to use 'sync' as-is, without any
 * additional coding, for free.
 * 
 * Assumption: the file list are given in a good order, the order of 
 * the #include inside the .nw files. Moreover it assumes the appended chunks
 * are defined in the good order too. As most of the time I use the multi
 * file in a very basic way, just to split a big .nw. this is not a problem
 * I think.
 * 
 * less? could introduce a MultiFileHack of Common.filename constructor
 * instead of abusing Tex
